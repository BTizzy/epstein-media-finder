# Epstein Data Set 9 Media Discovery Tool (FREE VERSION)

This repository provides a free, Python-based pipeline to identify under-discussed images and videos from the DOJ's Data Set 9 release (January 30, 2026) by using free web scraping techniques. No paid APIs or API keys are required.

Features
- Scrapes the DOJ Data Set 9 page to build a manifest of media files
- Downloads a configurable sample of media files
- Computes perceptual image hashes and metadata
- Uses free web scraping (Google, Reddit, Nitter) to estimate social presence
- Flags underreported media and generates a markdown report

Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- No API keys required (free tooling only)

Installation
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Copy example environment:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

Usage (step-by-step)
1. Fetch the manifest (scrapes DOJ):
   ```bash
   python scripts/01_fetch_dataset9_manifest.py
   ```
2. Download sample media (controlled by `MAX_MEDIA_TO_DOWNLOAD` in `.env`):
   ```bash
   python scripts/02_download_sample_media.py
   ```
3. Compute hashes and thumbnails:
   ```bash
   python scripts/03_hash_media.py
   ```
4. Check social presence (Google / Reddit / Nitter):
   ```bash
   python scripts/04_check_social_presence.py
   ```
5. Generate final report:
   ```bash
   python scripts/05_generate_report.py
   ```

Configuration
- `config/config.yaml` controls URLs, filters, nitter instances, search settings, and output paths.
- `.env` controls runtime limits such as `MAX_MEDIA_TO_DOWNLOAD` and `MAX_SOCIAL_SEARCHES_PER_HOUR`.

Output
- Manifest: `data/manifests/dataset9_media_manifest.csv`
- Hash database: `data/manifests/media_hashes.csv`
- Results (JSON/CSV): `data/results/underreported_media.json` / `data/results/underreported_media.csv`
- Final report: `data/results/FINAL_REPORT.md`

Limitations & Ethics
- Uses free web scraping only — counts are approximate and can change over time
- Respect robots.txt and rate limits; the pipeline includes delays and retries but you should be cautious when scaling
- Use responsibly and obey platform terms of service

Future Improvements
- Add video frame extraction and hashing
- Add better deduplication across similar images
- Optional authenticated API paths for more accurate counts (opt-in)
